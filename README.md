# CIFAR10 Image Classification

## Evaluation

CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.

## The label classes in the dataset are:

1. airplane <br> 
2. automobile <br> 
3. bird <br> 
4. cat <br> 
5. deer <br> 
6. dog <br> 
7. frog <br>  
8. horse <br> 
9. ship <br> 
10. truck <br> 

The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. "Automobile" includes sedans, SUVs, things of that sort. "Truck" includes only big trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks.

## Output:

Accuracy: ~82%
